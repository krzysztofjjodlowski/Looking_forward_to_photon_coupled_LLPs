# Secondary production routines and displaced decay signature at beam dump experiments for BSM scenarios with photon-coupled long-lived particles - implementation in FORESEE
**By Krzysztof Jodlowski**

We present modified version of [FORESEE](https://github.com/KlingFelix/FORESEE), where we implement:
1. secondary LLP production by coherent upscattering at $\text{FASER}\nu2$, followed by decay at either $\text{FASER}\nu2$ or $\text{FASER}2$, and electron scattering
2. displaced decay signature and secondary production routines at MATHUSLA
3. displaced decay signature at beam dump experiments, e.g., CHARM, NuCal, SHiP

# FORESEE: FORward Experiment SEnsitivity Estimator

**By Felix Kling and Sebastian Trojanowski**

We present the numerical package **FOR**ward **E**xperiment **SE**nsitivity **E**stimator, or **FORESEE**, that can be used to simulate the expected sensitivity reach of experiments placed in the far-forward direction from the proton-proton interaction point. We also provide a comprehensive list of validated forward spectra of various SM species. 

### Paper

Our main publication [FORESEE: FORward Experiment SEnsitivity Estimator for the LHC and future hadron colliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07077)
provides an overview over this package. We recommend reading it first before jumping into the code.
